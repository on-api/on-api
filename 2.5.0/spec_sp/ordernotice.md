# Order Notice

This API is intended to be used to notify the SP that the CO has activated a new SP product offering and corresponding
CO transmission product. It is not possible to reject a subscription through this API. To disconnect a subscription that
is unwanted, a DEACTIVATE order needs to be sent through the CO order API.

The purpose of this API is to support integration paths used historically where the CO or external portal activates the
CO transmission products and then notifies the SP, commonly via email. This API provides a more structured way to handle
this in an automatic approach. This API allows exchanging subscription and customer references automatically.

## Usage

The CO or external portal captures the order details on a given access, including selected product offering and customer
information, and places an activation order to the CO. As part of handling the order, the CO or external portal sends an
activation notice to the SP. The SP receives and validates the order, but is unable to reject the order directly in the
response. If the order is unwanted, the SP must instead handle this through the CO order API. If order is OK, the SP may
respond back with subscription and customer references.
