# Products

This API lists product offerings that are available to end customers and information about the service provider.

The definition of product offerings include campaigns as well as standard offerings.

* Allows the CO to periodically list all product offerings from SPs for publishing in portals
* Allows the CO to request product offerings on a specific access on-demand to ensure availability on that access

## Usage

The SP responds with a list of products and associated offerings, each associated to at least one CO product. The same CO transmission product 
can be used in multiple product offerings, and the same SP product can have multiple variants of offerings showing different prices and
conditions.

The product offerings structure is illustrated in the image below where "100/100" is offered in three different variants having the same base
productId but different offeringIds. Since offeringId can be used in multiple combinations of productId and 
offeringId, the CO must provide the combination of both when placing orders.

## Request

The request below is used to list all products and offerings made available by the SP in the CO network

```http
GET /onapi/2.5/products/
Content-Type: application/json
```

Add the "accessId" from the CO accesses API to list offerings available on the specific access. 
The list shall only contain the offerings that the SP wants to deliver to the specific accessId. 

```http
GET /onapi/2.5/products/{accessId}
Content-Type: application/json
```

Alternatively, the post method below can be used to list offerings on the specific access. When this endpoint is used, 
the CO has already performed a feasibility check and added the result in the request.

Given an array of CO transmission products, the service provider responds with a list of offerings 
available on the specific access. 

The "coProduct" is the same field as services/service specified in the CO endpoint [accesses API](../spec/accesses.md)

```http 
POST /onapi/2.5/products/{accessId}
Content-Type: application/json
```

```
{
  "coProducts": 
  [
  	"10/10",
  	"100/10",
  	"100/100",
  	"250/100",
  	"250/250",
  	"500/100",
  	"500/500",
  	"1000/100",
  	"1000/1000"
  ]
}
```

Response:

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```
