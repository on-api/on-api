# Order

This API is used to order a product offering from the service provider. The service provider is responsible for the
delivery of the order.

## Usage

The portal captures the order details on a given access, including selected product offering and customer information,
and places an order request to the SP. The SP receives and validates the order and activates the CO transmission
products in the CO network. The SP can also decide to reject the order, in which case the portal is able to present a
relevant message to end customer.
