# CO Order

This API is intended to be used by the CO to send an order for approval to the SP before connecting the transmission
products.

## Usage

The CO captures the order details on a given access, including selected product offering and customer information, and
sends a CO order request to the SP. The SP validates the order and customer and either rejects or confirms the order. 

Depending on the results, the CO will present relevant feedback to the customer.

Error handling should use HTTP status codes, and optionally set the "cause" field to communicate what went wrong. If the
server has an ID of the error (such as a fault number or, even better, a ticket ID) it should be included in the cause
field. The message included in the "cause" field must never be displayed to the customer, but it may be logged on the CO
system.

Anything else than status 200 will result in an immediate cancellation of the order, and only the "cause" field is
allowed. This should be seen as an exception, and a generic error message should be presented for the customer.

Status 200 should always be returned as long as the order message itself is correct, mandatory fields are supplied, and
the message can be parsed and handled in a managed way, and there is nothing specific in the error that is not suitable
to present to the customer.

For instance, if there are any mandatory information missing in the customer details that the order capture portal would
be assumed to validate and prevent, this should result in status 400. On the other hand, if the customer cannot be
accepted because the credit check fails, this should be communicated to the customer in an informative way.

Example 1 (invalid data):

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "cause": "Invalid offeringId: bf134676-0830-4d61-8af0-94f00a0270da"
}
```

Example 2 (whoops, something went wrong):

```http
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "cause": "Unknown error has occurred. Error number 12345."
}
```

Example 3 (offering not available):

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "state": "REJECTED",
  "externalMessage": "We are sorry, but the selected offering is no longer available on your location. Please contact us for more information and alternatives."
}
```
