## Open Networks API

Open Networks API (ON-API) is a communication protocol which enables automation of processes between Service Providers (SP) and Service Operators (SO).
This is done via a standardized machine-to-machine interface (REST api) specification with requirements of how data should be processed and presented.
The main purpose of the API is to provide automated communication as an alternative to manual processes. 

The specification includes support for areas such as:

- Addresses
- Orders
- Subscriptions
- Tickets
- Troubleshooting
- Invoicing

In summary, the API is a specification which defines how data shall be formatted and transmitted between parties, for a machine to be able to interpret the data from a set of rules, as opposed to human interpretation.  
An example is the manual order process, where the Service Provider must first activate a service in an internal system, followed by either requesting an external activation by e-mail or in an external system. This process is replaced by a machine on each end that will automatically interpret the data in an order and perform the requested operation.
