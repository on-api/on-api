# Accesses API

Path /2.4/accesses/

The accesses API is used to get available access points. The accesses contain details about the address where the 
access resides, available services, equipment and activated services. 
  
## Operations

### GET

#### All accesses 
```HTTP
GET /onapi/2.4/accesses/ HTTP/1.1
```

Response 
```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Last-Modified: Mon, 04 Feb 2019 18:22:33 GMT
```

Response if no available accesses
```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND
Content-Type: application/json
Last-Modified: Mon, 04 Feb 2019 18:22:33 GMT
```

#### Updates

To get changes since the last GET operation include the If-Modified-Since header using the value of the "Last-Modified" 
header from the previous response. 

Request
```HTTP
GET /onapi/2.4/accesses/ HTTP/1.1
If-Modified-Since: Mon, 04 Feb 2019 18:12:33 GMT
```

See [RFC-2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html) for more details about HTTP-headers.


Array listing one or more accesses. The API response must contain the Last-Modified header when returning one or more 
accesses. 


Response
```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

```

Response if no updates is available 
```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Example from all accesses and updates responses

When all accesses or updates are requested the response contains a JSON-array with JSON-objects.

#### Single access

To get a single access use `accessId` as key. The single access contains details about activated services and the services
 available for activation.
 
Request
```http
GET /onapi/2.4/accesses/{accessId} HTTP/1.1
```

Response 
```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```
#### Example data from a single access response 

When a single access is requested the response contains a single JSON-object.
