# Events

Path: /onapi/2.4/events

Lists object changes. 

## Operations 

### GET

#### All available events
Get all events stored in the system up to the previous second. Events should be stored for a minimum of 24 hours.
Events for the current second is omitted to ensure that events are not sent twice. This is to get around a limitation 
in the "If-Modified-Since" header that does not allow fractional seconds. 

```HTTP
GET /onapi/2.4/events/ HTTP/1.1
```

Response 
```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

Last-Modified: Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:03:15 GMT

    "time": "2019-02-04T13:03:16.5230"
  }
]
```

### New events

Use the "Last-Modified" header value as parameter for "If-Modified-Since" header to fetch new events. This operation 
needs to be fairly lightweight on the API-server side to allow rapid requests.

Request
```HTTP
GET /onapi/2.4/events/ HTTP/1.1
If-Modified-Since: Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:03:15 GMT
```

Response
```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Last-Modified: Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:03:16 GMT
```

Response if no updates is available 
```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
Content-Type: application/json
```
